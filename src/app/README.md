App
==

This is a sample skeleton app which might be used by generator to generate apps.

Todo
==

* [x] Bookmarks
* [x] Photo Upload
* [ ] Edit/Delete APIs and options
* Alter App based on entity schema (Entity, Search)
  * [ ] Make `Entity/Header`, `SearchBar`, `SearchItem`, `server/db/` `server/api/entities` rely on `config.js` that describes schema.
  * [ ] Search Filters
* [ ] Home Feed
* [ ] Roles for users (data entry [startup side], entity owner, normal)

Optional
==
* [ ] Social Share
* [ ] Use [sentimental analysis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sentiment-analysis), save score on update and allow sorting reviews and entities based on it.
